//** FLOW **// we are animating elements

DEFINE THE ANIMATIONS in ROUTE-ANIMATIONS.TS

1/ your animations are defined in
"route-animations.ts"

2/ in route-animations create an animation.
    a/ the "fader" const is equal to a function called "trigger".
      export const fader =
        trigger("routeAnimations",[
        ])
    b/ the trigger function takes in a string - "routeAnimations"
    which is how you will bind this animation to the html template

    c/ for "trigger" to work, you must import it from the animations
    library:
        import {trigger} from "@angular/animations"


3/ Trigger continued.
  angular will apply two pseudo selectors to the elements that we are animating.
      a. :enter - new page
      b. :leave - old page 





1/ prepareRoute(outlet) in app.component.html
determine which animation to apply to a given route.

2/ This is a way to grab router outlet data in order
to animate it
<router-outlet #outlet="outlet"></router-outlet>
define the outlet
#outlet = is the template variable name.
Whenever a route changes,
you can animate whatever is in
"router-outlet"
